This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript bug involving type coercion.  The `bug.as` file shows incorrect type handling that leads to unexpected string concatenation when adding a Number and a String. The `bugSolution.as` file provides the corrected code with explicit type conversion using `Number()` to avoid the issue. This highlights the importance of careful type handling in ActionScript to prevent runtime errors and ensure correct program behavior.
